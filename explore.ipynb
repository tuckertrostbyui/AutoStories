       "'More context: We were out to dinner one night at an expensive hotel. My boyfriend let me borrow his Canon G7X (1800) camera to bring to take pictures with my friends. At the conclusion of the dinner, I went up to the room and realized the camera was gone. I went back right down to the table and no one had seen it. I immediately got with hotel security and she is on video, clear as day, swiping the camera when my back was turned and shoving it in her purse. I covered for her initially with my friend, and contacted her to find a resolution. She had taken the camera with her and my other friends to a club after dinner, which I did not attend, and lost it there. For background, this is my good college friend who I know well (the camera thief). She has been taken on free trips to Coachella and St Barths on my dime (not kidding), as well as many other things. We have done a lot together and are good friends, so I expected her to feel sorry. Initially she lied, saying she did not have it. When I told her we had video, she confessed and then said yes she took it but lost it at the next bar she went to with my other friends. It is now gone. I asked her to help me replace it by going in on me with the cost. She has refused all measured or resolutions, and now I feel I have nothing left to do but file a police report and let them handle it. It is impacting my relationship, and I am furious my friend is not helping at all. Why should I be on the hook for something she stole? I have given her three weeks to help me resolve this, but she insists she is going to do nothing. I am being pressed by my boyfriend to either replace the camera or help him file a report with her info and the footage. I even asked her to just throw in half or less than half the cost to help, but she still refuses. I do not want her to get in trouble, but I am at the point where I feel she really does not care.\\n\\nUPDATE: I sent her a text this AM telling her if I do not receive full cost of the camera or shipping confirmation of a new camera from an approved vendor to a provided address by end of day Friday, we will be filing a report with the police Saturday AM. I felt like an asshole typing this out to her, but I have to do it.\\n\\nUPDATE X2: She told me she is sick of me and that I will be receiving a tracking number by 12 eastern on friday and not to blame her if the package is never receieved. I told her if she was my real friend, she would be sorry and in no way will I allow this to be flipped on me. Should I ask if the camera is new, or the one that \"Dissapeared\"? '"

My husband rented a great small chair. I can even roll myself – it\\'s actually a good workout! I’ve been practicing maneuvers in our local shopping center.\\nLast weekend, my husband and I were at a small zoo. He was getting coffee, and I waited outside a restaurant. Then, a kid, maybe seven, and his dad approached. They were super curious about my wheelchair.\\nLook, I totally get that kids are curious. But I barely understand why I\\'m in this chair myself right now. I was definitely not in the mood to explain my personal issues or give an impromptu lesson. So, I kept it simple. I just told them, \"Sometimes someone\\'s leg doesn\\'t work.\"\\nBut that only led to more questions. I finally said directly, \"I don\\'t want to answer any more questions right now, I\\'m just too tired.\" The dad was NOT happy. He actually said it would be a \"good lesson\" for his kid. I wanted to tell him I\\'m not some zoo exhibit, but with the kid right there, I just didn\\'t want to cause a scene. Luckily, my husband appeared with coffee right then and quickly rolled me away.\\nSo, Am I the Asshole for not wanting to educate this kid about my wheelchair?'"

I didn’t mind once or twice if it was on my way, but it quickly became an everyday expectation. He’d call me every night to confirm the pickup.

I end up rushing to find parking and get to class. And he hasn't offered any money for gas. So, I told him directly I can't be his daily driver. I have my own busy schedule and a part-time job to juggle. My friend just kept saying, “Not cool, bro. Not cool.” I reminded him that selling his car for tickets wasn't cool if he couldn't afford the consequences. It’s not my responsibility. He hung up on me while I was still talking. I don't think I'm wrong. He needs to be responsible for his choices, not use me as his daily ride. So, Am I the Asshole for refusing to drive him?\""
